# Bootcamp

This repo exists for one and only "DS start" course from NRU HSE (rus. НИУ ВШЭ).

Course is providing with basics to Data Science, such as base Python syntax, OOP, SQL, Streamlit, Jaconda and Google Colab.

Decorators are very raw. Stacking one on top of another causes problems such as mixing attributes (Benchmark_Decorator returning func name as 'wrapper' instead of origin func name, Counter_Decorator returns time for every iteration for recursive func). I'm not gonna fix this cus this repo was made to learn smth about decorators and OOP, I learned what I needed and this is where the reasons to work on repo ends. Have fun trying to rewrite it if you need to.
